In order to run this app, you will need to create a .env file in your root directory.
Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/ and login/register and get a free version of apikey at 
https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. Pass the key below as a string.

Also, in order for users to input the city name field, google autocomplete has been added.
For the API_KEY to work, Google Places API and Google Maps Javascript API both have been utilized.

```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY={YOUR API KEY}
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY={YOUR API KEY}
```
